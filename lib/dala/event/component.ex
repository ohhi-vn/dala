defmodule Dala.Event.Component do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for **stateful** event-owning components.

  See `guides/event_model.md` for the model. In short:

  - **Stateless** components are plain functions: `(assigns) -> render_tree`.
    They have no event horizon — events fired inside their subtree resolve to
    the nearest stateful ancestor.
  - **Stateful** components implement `Dala.Event.Component`. They own events
    fired in their subtree and may escalate semantic events to their parent.

  This is the Dala equivalent of `Phoenix.LiveComponent`.

  ## Status

  This is the **interface declaration**. The runtime that hosts these
  components — registering them in render trees, routing events to them,
  managing their lifecycle — is implemented incrementally:

  1. Existing `Dala.Component` (a sibling concept for native_view widgets)
     remains the runtime for components that pair with custom native views.
  2. `Dala.Event.Component` (this module) is the *event-routing* abstraction:
     a stateful owner of events for a subtree of standard widgets.
  3. The two will likely merge once the new event model is plumbed end-to-end.

  Until then, the Bridge module handles the legacy event shapes and the
  existing `Dala.Component` is the canonical stateful component.

          send(state.parent_pid, {:form_submitted, state.email})
          {:noreply, state}
