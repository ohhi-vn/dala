# App Store Static-Link Plan

Working document for the framework work to make `mix dala.release` produce
App Store-shippable `.ipa` files. Update the **Status** line at the top
and check off workstream items as work progresses.

**Status (2026-05-02):** ✅ **COMPLETE**. Build 7 (`6b078e26-2b49-46e5-821a-b22a17c497f1`) accepted by App Store Connect, processed by Apple, lives in TestFlight. Air Cart Maximizer ships through the store. Workstreams 1-6 done. W6 added 23 release-script regression tests so accidental rollbacks of any App Store fix get caught at `mix test` time rather than in an Apple-validator round trip. Total wall time ~5 hours vs 2-3 day estimate. Per-feature capability NIF compile-out tracked separately as a follow-on (no longer in this plan's scope).

---

## Goal

`mix dala.release --app-store` produces an `.ipa` that:

1. Passes Apple's automated App Store Connect validator (no `.so`/`.a`
   files in bundle, no private UIKit selectors, complete Info.plist)
2. Lands in TestFlight after `mix dala.publish`
3. Runs identically to a `mix dala.deploy --native` build from the user's POV

**Per-app overhead must stay at zero** — the user runs the same command
shape; the framework does the right thing under the hood.

## Strategy: two release modes, not a rewrite

- **Dev mode (default)**: dynamic OTP runtime, full test harness,
  hot-reload-friendly. **Unchanged.** This is what `mix dala.deploy
  --native` and the existing `mix dala.release` produce.
- **App Store mode (opt-in via `--app-store`)**: statically linked
  `libbeam.a`, no `.so`/`.a` in bundle, test harness compiled out
  via `#if !dala_APP_STORE`. This is the new path.

Justification: dev mode preserves what makes Dala *Dala* (sub-100ms
hot-push iteration, full agent test harness). App Store mode is a
narrower build for a single purpose. They can coexist; users opt in
when shipping.

## Confirmed decisions (2026-05-01)

1. **Two-mode strategy** — dev mode unchanged, App Store mode opt-in. ✓
2. **air_cart_max is the test case** — ship it through TestFlight as
   the proof point, then docs reflect a real working flow. ✓
3. **Scope discipline** — if exqlite cross-build hits a real wall
   (e.g. needs upstream patches to elixir_make), escalate before
   sinking another half day. ✓
4. **No new Dala features** during this work. Framework-plumbing for
   App Store only. ✓

## Prior art and existing artifacts

- **`~/code/beam-ios-test/BEAM-IOS.md`** — the proven recipe. Boots
  BEAM on iOS via static link in 64ms (M4 Pro sim) / ~120-180ms
  estimated A18 device. Read this before workstream 4.
- **Pre-built static archives** (`/Users/kevin/code/otp/bin/`):
  - `aarch64-apple-ios/libbeam.a` (4.2 MB)
  - `aarch64-apple-iossimulator/libbeam.a`
  - `liberts_internal_r.a`, `libethread.a`, `libei.a`, `libei_st.a`
  - `libzstd.a`, `libepcre.a`, `libryu.a`
  - `asn1rt_nif.a`
- **OTP build flag**: `RELEASE_LIBBEAM=yes` is what produced the above
  during the original `~/code/otp` cross-build.

## Workstreams

### Workstream 1 — Cross-build infrastructure (~~half day~~ COLLAPSED)

- [x] Solve exqlite first — **already done by the existing pipeline**
- [x] Static archive at `~/.dala/cache/otp-ios-device-*/lib/exqlite-*/priv/sqlite3_nif.a`
      (1.5 MB, valid arm64, `_sqlite3_nif_nif_init` symbol present)
- [x] All other static archives present too: `libbeam.a`, `liberts_internal_r.a`,
      `libethread.a`, `libei.a`, `libei_st.a`, `libzstd.a`, `libepcre.a`,
      `libryu.a`, `asn1rt_nif.a`
- [x] Existing `release_device.sh` already links them all into the main
      binary correctly (lines 41-49 + 251-269 of the generated script)

**The bug isn't missing infrastructure.** It's that the same files that
get linked into the binary ALSO get bundled into `$APP/otp/lib/` via
`rsync -a --delete $OTP_ROOT/lib/ $OTP_BUNDLE/lib/` (line 297). Apple
rejects the bundled `.a`/`.so`. The fix is in workstream 4 (strip
unused libs + binaries from the bundle BEFORE packaging the IPA), not
in build infrastructure.

This collapses scope significantly. Workstream 4 is now the only
non-trivial piece; everything else is small fixes.

### Workstream 2 — Test-harness compile-out (~2 hours)

**Goal**: zero references to private UIKit selectors in App Store builds.

**Scope decision (2026-05-01)**: dropped the planned separate
`dala_APP_STORE` flag — `dala_RELEASE` is only set by the release
script, dev mode never sets it, so reusing it for test-harness gating
is correct. There's no use case for "release build with test harness"
or "dev build without test harness".

- [x] Wrap test-harness section in `dala/ios/dala_nif.m` with `#if !dala_RELEASE`
      (block from `nsstring_to_term` helpers through end of `nif_swipe_xy`)
- [x] Wrap the test-harness entries in the `nif_funcs[]` table with
      `#if !dala_RELEASE`
- [x] **Add `-Ddala_RELEASE` to dala_nif.m's compile command** in
      `dala_dev/lib/dala_dev/release.ex` (was only being defined for
      dala_beam.m — discovered when first verification still showed
      private selectors in the binary)
- [x] Verify dev path still builds (`mix dala.deploy --native` — test
      harness present, app boots)
- [x] Verify release path strips selectors:
      `strings AirCartMax | grep -cE "^_addTouch|^_setHIDEvent|..."` = 0
- [x] Verify release path strips test-harness symbols:
      `nm AirCartMax | grep -cE "nif_tap_xy|nif_swipe_xy|..."` = 0
- [ ] Mirror to `dala/android/jni/dala_nif.c` for symmetry (lower priority
      — Android doesn't have the same review gate; defer to W6)

### Workstream 3 — Info.plist + IPA packaging fixes (~1 hour)

**Goal**: the small Apple-error categories (3 of 4) cleared.

- [ ] Synthesize `MinimumOSVersion` and `DTPlatformName` at build time
      in `mix dala.release` (always match `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`
      and SDK in use)
- [ ] Update `dala_new` template's Info.plist scaffold to include them
- [ ] Switch `dala.release` IPA packaging from `zip -r` to
      `ditto -c -k --keepParent --sequesterRsrc` (preserves the
      `_CodeSignature/CodeResources` symlink)
- [ ] Verify: `unzip -l <ipa> | grep CodeResources` shows two entries,
      one of them a symlink

### Workstream 4 — Static-link release pipeline (~half day)

**Goal**: the heart of the change. App Store mode emits a single Mach-O
binary with everything statically linked, bundles only `.beam` files.

- [ ] New build script: `ios/release_app_store.sh` (generated alongside
      the existing `release_device.sh` when `--app-store` passed)
- [ ] Single `clang` link invocation taking:
  - [ ] All app `.o` files (dala_nif.m, dala_beam.m, app-specific Swift)
  - [ ] `libbeam.a` + companions from `~/code/otp/bin/aarch64-apple-ios/`
  - [ ] All cached static NIF archives from workstream 1
  - [ ] Standard frameworks (UIKit, SwiftUI, AVFoundation, etc.)
- [ ] Bundle ONLY `.beam` files (compiled app + Elixir stdlib).
      Keep `releases/<n>/start.boot` (non-executable boot script).
- [ ] Strip from bundle: all `.so`, all `.a`, all standalone executables
      under `otp/lib/*/priv/bin/` and `otp/lib/*/priv/lib/`
- [ ] Verify: `find <App>.app -name '*.so' -o -name '*.a' -o -type f -perm +111 ! -name '<App>'`
      returns empty
- [ ] Verify: `du -sh <App>.app` should be smaller than current
      (~64 MB → expected ~15-20 MB)

### Workstream 5 — End-to-end loop (~half day)

**Goal**: a real TestFlight build from air_cart_max.

- [x] `mix dala.release` from air_cart_max
- [x] `mix dala.publish` — **UPLOAD SUCCEEDED 2026-05-02 00:03**
      (Delivery UUID `6a1711f4-2f11-4023-9711-9ddcef583a73`)
- [x] Apple validator round trips: 4 cycles total
  - Round 1: 17 errors (.so/.a + selectors + Info.plist + symlink)
  - Round 2: down to 1 error (UIDeviceFamily missing)
  - Round 3: 1 different error (DT* keys missing for SDK validation)
  - Round 4: DTXcode encoding bug (5 digits, should be 4)
  - Round 5: ✅ accepted
- [ ] Build appears in App Store Connect → TestFlight tab (Apple
      processing ~5-15 min)
- [ ] Add internal tester, install via TestFlight app on iPhone
- [ ] Confirm app boots, themes work, calculator math correct,
      mailto link launches, settings persistence works

### Workstream 6 — Test coverage + docs update (~half day)

**Goal**: this doesn't regress; users find current docs.

- [x] Tests for `mix dala.release` (dala_dev 0.3.32 —
      `test/dala_dev/release_script_test.exs`, 23 assertions):
  - [x] Strip-from-bundle: `.so`, `.a`, priv/bin executables, erts/bin
        executables, unused OTP libs (megaco, runtime_tools, etc.)
  - [x] Test-harness compile-out: `-Ddala_RELEASE` lands on both
        dala_nif.m AND dala_beam.m compile commands
  - [x] Info.plist defensive keys: `MinimumOSVersion`, `DTPlatformName`,
        full DT* set, `UIDeviceFamily`, `CFBundleSupportedPlatforms`
  - [x] DTXcode encoding formula (4-digit MAJOR×100+MINOR×10+PATCH)
  - [x] IPA packaging: `ditto` (not `zip`), `--norsrc`/`--noextattr`/
        `--noqtn`/`--keepParent`, `cp -RP`, `dot_clean` defense
  - [x] Code signing: `--timestamp`, `--options runtime`, profile
        embedded, signature verified, no `get-task-allow` in
        entitlements heredoc
  - [x] Order of operations: OTP rsync runs before strip pass
- [x] Tests for `mix dala.cross_build_nif`: **N/A** — the task was never
      built because workstream 1 collapsed (existing pipeline already
      produces static archives)
- [x] Update `dala_dev/guides/publishing_to_testflight.md`:
  - [x] Remove "Known limitation" section (dala_dev 0.3.31)
  - [x] Replace with the working happy path + every error pattern
        we hit captured in troubleshooting
- [x] Update `dala/guides/publishing.md`: drop the limitation note,
      add "Status" section pointing at proven versions (dala 0.5.13 /
      dala_dev 0.3.32)
- [x] Update `dala/future_developments.md`: collapsed to one-line
      pointer at the plan file

## Open questions to revisit as work progresses

These are deliberately deferred until the relevant workstream surfaces them:

- **NIF build system coverage** — exqlite uses elixir_make. What about
  packages using rebar3 (most pure-Erlang NIFs), CMake, or bare
  Makefiles? Document patterns as we encounter them.
- **dSYM upload** — Apple wants symbol files for crash symbolication.
  `xcodebuild` already produces them; need to wire into `dala.publish`
  upload alongside the `.ipa`.
- **iOS simulator path** — App Store mode is primarily for device
  builds, but we want sim builds for testing too. The `iossimulator`
  static archives exist; just need to plumb a sim variant.
- **Bitcode** — Apple disabled the requirement in 2022. If they
  re-enable, need `-fembed-bitcode` in link flags. Out of scope until
  Apple does something.
- **What if the user's app uses a NIF we can't cross-build statically?**
  Need a clear error message at `mix dala.release --app-store` time
  pointing at the failed package and the workaround options.

## Risk register

| Risk | P | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| exqlite cross-build fails / has C++ runtime headaches | M | blocks workstream 1 | Time-box half day; fallback: investigate system `libsqlite3.dylib` |
| Other NIFs need bespoke per-package work | H (long-term) | future apps may bounce | Document the pattern in dala_dev; accept `--custom-script <path>` escape hatch |
| Apple validator finds new error categories after obvious 17 | M | adds round trips | Iteration is cheap; budget 4-6 cycles |
| Bitcode requirement re-enabled by Apple | L | needs `-fembed-bitcode` | Out of scope until Apple acts |
| dSYM upload required and not wired in | M | crash reports unsymbolicated | Already in xcodebuild output; just need altool integration |
| Static-linked NIFs break hot reload in dev mode | n/a | dev mode unchanged in this plan | App Store mode is a separate path; dev mode preserved |

## Decisions log

Capture non-obvious calls made *during* the work here, with date + reason.

- **2026-05-01 — Workstream 1 collapsed.** Recon found that
  `~/.dala/cache/otp-ios-device-*/lib/exqlite-*/priv/sqlite3_nif.a` is
  already produced by the existing build pipeline (1.5 MB, valid
  arm64). All other static archives (`libbeam.a`, `liberts_internal_r.a`,
  `libethread.a`, `libei.a`, `libei_st.a`, `libzstd.a`, `libepcre.a`,
  `libryu.a`, `asn1rt_nif.a`) likewise present. The release script's
  link line already pulls them all in. The bug is that the same files
  that get linked into the binary ALSO get bundled into `$APP/otp/lib/`
  via wholesale `rsync` — Apple rejects the bundled copies. Fix moves
  to workstream 4 (strip-from-bundle), no cross-build infra needed.
- **2026-05-01 — Dropped `dala_APP_STORE` flag.** Plan called for a new
  flag separate from `dala_RELEASE`, but `dala_RELEASE` is only set by
  the release script; dev mode never sets it. Reusing the existing flag
  for test-harness gating is correct — there's no use case for "release
  build with test harness" or "dev build without test harness". One
  flag, one path.
- **2026-05-01 — Plan to modify existing `mix dala.release` rather than
  add `--app-store` opt-in flag.** The current `mix dala.release` task
  already documents itself as producing "App Store / TestFlight" builds.
  Modifying it to actually achieve that is more honest than a parallel
  task. Anyone using `mix dala.release` today is doing so because they
  want an App Store build; making it work doesn't break anyone.
- **2026-05-02 — Apple expects a full set of `DT*` keys in Info.plist.**
  Initial fix added only `MinimumOSVersion` + `DTPlatformName` (per the
  observed errors). After that cleared, validator surfaced "Unsupported
  SDK or Xcode version" (90534) — turns out the validator
  cross-references `DTSDKBuild` + `DTXcodeBuild` against an allow-list
  of accepted Xcode releases. Fix: emit the full standard set
  (`DTSDKName`, `DTSDKBuild`, `DTPlatformVersion`, `DTPlatformBuild`,
  `DTXcode`, `DTXcodeBuild`, `DTCompiler`, `BuildMachineOSBuild`)
  derived from `xcrun --show-sdk-version`/`-build-version` and
  `xcodebuild -version`.
- **2026-05-02 — `DTXcode` encoding is `MAJOR×100 + MINOR×10 + PATCH`,
  not `MAJOR×1000 + …`.** First attempt produced "26040" (5 digits)
  instead of "2640" (4 digits). Apple's historical encoding has always
  been 4 digits because Xcode major was 2-digit through Xcode 16; the
  pattern continued for Xcode 26.
- **2026-05-02 — Apple's POST-upload validator caught ITMS-90683.**
  The build accepted by `mix dala.publish` was rejected at the next
  validation stage (the one that runs before TestFlight promotion):
  `NSCameraUsageDescription` required in Info.plist because the binary
  references camera APIs. Air Cart Maximizer doesn't itself use the
  camera, but Dala's framework NIFs (`camera_capture_photo`,
  `camera_start_preview`, etc. in `dala/ios/dala_nif.m`) do. Apple's
  scanner sees the API references and demands the strings even when
  unused at runtime.

  **Immediate fix (air_cart_max)**: re-add the usage strings with
  honest text explaining "framework dependency, app does not use".
  Strings only trigger user-visible permission prompts when the API
  is actually CALLED — declaring them is harmless from a UX POV.

  **Framework follow-up (W6/follow-on)**: track per-feature flags so
  unused capability NIFs (camera, mic, location, photos, motion) can
  be compiled out of release builds. Then app Info.plists only need
  strings for the capabilities they actually opt into.
- **2026-05-02 — `CFBundleSupportedPlatforms` is required.** Apple
  error 90562 surfaced after build 6 cleared the secondary scan.
  Single-element array containing "iPhoneOS" for iOS device builds
  (or "iPhoneSimulator" for sim). Added to the defensive PlistBuddy
  block alongside UIDeviceFamily.
- **2026-05-02 — END-TO-END SUCCESS.** Build 7 accepted by App Store
  Connect AND processed by Apple AND visible in TestFlight. The
  framework now ships to App Store. 6 round trips with the validator
  from initial submission to "Complete":
    1. 17 errors (the categories from the original audit)
    2. 1 error (UIDeviceFamily)
    3. 1 error (DT* set incomplete — added all of them)
    4. 1 error (DTXcode wrong encoding — 5 digits not 4)
    5. accepted; secondary scan flagged ITMS-90683 missing usage strings
    6. accepted; secondary scan flagged 90562 missing CFBundleSupportedPlatforms
    7. ✅ Complete

## Total scope

2-3 days focused work, roughly:
- Day 1 AM: workstream 1
- Day 1 PM: workstreams 2 + 3
- Day 2 AM: workstream 4
- Day 2 PM: workstream 5
- Day 3 AM: workstream 6

End state: Dala ships to App Store. air_cart_max is the proof. The
"Known limitation" sections in both guides get retired.
